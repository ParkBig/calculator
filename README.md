### `주요 기능`

수를 입력하면 즉시 입력된 수들의 합, 평균, 최대값, 최소값, 최대값 - 최소값, 최대값 - 평균값, 평균값 - 최소값을 알 수 있으며, 원형 그래프를 통해 시각적으로 파악 할 수 있습니다.
또한 그룹별로 최대 5개까지 각 비교 그룹을 만들고 그 그룹들을 전체 비교하여 앞서 말한 값을 구할 수 있습니다.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
